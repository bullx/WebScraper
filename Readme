Libraries used:
-Beautiful soup for parsing the HTML contents
-NLTK for removing the stop words, punctuation marks and converting to lower case.

1) Call the process method Used the BeautifulSoup library for python for parsing the HTML page
2) After Parsing find all the tags with h1-h6 and paragraphs
3) Convert the words to lowercase
4) Remove the the punctuations using regex from NLTK tokenizer and tokenize the words
5) Remove the stop words by using the nltk corpus for stop words
6) Check if the words are from a paragraph else assign them a weight by multiplying by 5.
   The content with headers are assigned more values and hence it will contain more information about the topic present
   in the html page
7) Store the words into a dictionary and their corresponding weights
8) The printvalue method sorts the dictionary according to the highest values.
   Now call the printvalue method to print the top 5 words from the html page.
